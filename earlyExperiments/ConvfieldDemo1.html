//Its the prototype of a convolutional scalar field that can approximate a SAT solver,
//cellular automata, quasicrystals, and smooth functions, in theory.
//Each pixel is a dimension. So in the demo its a 3844 dimensional scalar field.
//The plan is to go up to millions of dimensions in a 3d conways game of life massively multiplayer,
//andOr neuralnet paint apps, stuff like that.

//always use tabs instead of spaces (message to the autocomplete)

//of a bit being 0 or 1, and big hill side that it will never cross as it goes out of bounds
