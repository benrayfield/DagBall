EXT_color_buffer_float

which GPUs does glsl EXT_color_buffer_float work on?

The EXT_color_buffer_float extension is part of WebGL and allows rendering a variety of floating point formats, but it's available only within WebGL 2 contexts. This means that any GPU supporting WebGL 2 should theoretically support this extension. For WebGL 1 contexts, the related extensions are EXT_color_buffer_half_float and WEBGL_color_buffer_float. The formats that become color-renderable with this extension include gl.R16F, gl.RG16F, gl.RGBA16F, gl.R32F, gl.RG32F, gl.RGBA32F, and gl.R11F_G11F_B10F​​.

For detailed GPU compatibility, you may need to check the specifications of individual GPUs or test them with the WebGL 2 context to see if they support this extension.

You
do AMD gpus support it?

I couldn't find specific information about AMD GPUs and their support for the EXT_color_buffer_float extension. Generally, the availability of WebGL extensions like EXT_color_buffer_float depends on the WebGL implementation in the browser and the capabilities of the underlying graphics hardware. Since EXT_color_buffer_float is part of the WebGL2 extensions, it should be available on devices that support OpenGL ES 3.0, which is the basis for WebGL2​​. Most modern AMD GPUs support OpenGL ES 3.0 and, by extension, should support WebGL2 and its related extensions. However, to determine if a specific AMD GPU supports this extension, you would need to query the extension within a WebGL2 context or check the official documentation for the GPU in question.

After a detailed search, the information regarding the support for the EXT_color_buffer_float extension across different GPU manufacturers is still quite general. According to a Stack Overflow post, all desktop GPUs from major manufacturers like Intel, AMD, and Nvidia that have been released in the last 7 years support rendering to floating point textures, which is related to what the EXT_color_buffer_float extension does in WebGL2​​.

However, for mobile GPUs, the support is not as widespread, and they usually do not support rendering to floating point textures, although they do support reading from them unfiltered. The EXT_color_buffer_float extension is not really a supported extension in WebGL1 contexts and seems to have been added as an afterthought​​.

From the documentation for Nvidia's DRIVE OS, it is indicated that Nvidia's products support OpenGL ES 2 and 3 specifications​​, with specific versions of the OpenGL ES specifications listed, including 3.2​​, 3.1​​, 3.0​​, and 2.0​​. Since the EXT_color_buffer_float extension is part of WebGL2, which is based on OpenGL ES 3.0 standards, Nvidia's support for these standards suggests compatibility with the extension.

Furthermore, the Nvidia documentation states that eglCreateContext function automatically promotes requests for an OpenGL ES 2 or 3 context to an OpenGL ES 3.1 one, which is backward compatible with OpenGL ES 2​​. Also, the list of OpenGL ES extensions supported in the Nvidia DRIVE OS release includes several extensions, but not explicitly EXT_color_buffer_float​​.

In summary, while there is no explicit list categorizing GPUs by manufacturer regarding the support for EXT_color_buffer_float, the evidence suggests that recent desktop GPUs from Intel, AMD, and Nvidia should support this extension due to their compatibility with OpenGL ES 3.0 and WebGL2 standards. For definitive compatibility for a specific GPU model, it would be best to refer to the manufacturer's official documentation or test the GPU with a WebGL2 context.
