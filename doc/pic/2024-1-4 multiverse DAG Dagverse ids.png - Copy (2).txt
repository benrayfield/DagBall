DagBall - 1000 dimensional hackerspace
@DagBallGame
Im working on the multiverse DAG forest. All values are json. A small list, like a ball's name and y and x position and velocity (4 floats) is about 50 long so use it as it is. Bigger jsons get hashed and base64ed. By turning each of these ids on/off you can navigate multiverse.

After this redesign, at any moment, the game state of a 30 player online game will be a set of about 200 ids, some of which refer to a bigger json. The game proceeds by about 60 times per second turning on/off some of those. So it can be viewed as timeSeries in sparse dimensions.

These ids can contain custom GPU code that will, after handle memory fencing of pointer arithmetic in GPU, get copied to other players in same game room / namespace. If players want to agree on some rules, like "no racist speech" or whatever, u could put a "rules" var in the ids.

Those who dont like some set of rules or technical GPU behaviors are free to turn on/off whatever combos of ids they want. The multiverse will fork and merge with the efficiency of a billions of variables SAT solver.

There is no time variable. Some combos of ids fit together and others dont. Its more like thermodynamic time. If you run this game through a physical wormhole to the past around a grandfather paradox, in theory it should still work at low lag.

For example you might turn a$sBall5_mp1445143_mp1417797_3p4333333e30_mp021837 on which claims sBall5's y position is -.1445143, or you might turn on a$sBall5_3_4_5_73p2 which claims its 3. These might be checkboxes.

Making the small ids human readable, of name, position, and velocity of a ball, should allow LLMs to read a$sBall5_mp1445143_mp1417797_3p4333333e30_mp021837 and make predictions about where the balls will roll next and change that by playing the game.

All ids are valid javascript var names. let a$sBall5_mp1445143_mp1417797_3p4333333e30_mp021837 = .73;
