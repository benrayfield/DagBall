Dagball can now learn shapes by example using mouse to tell it good/bad of the current shape in any GPU_circle that you've used the button to put a tiny neuralnet in. Watch as I live train this fractal and save it into neuralnet_1707143607.8198001.dagball

DagBall V139 learns fractal shape using 1 layer RBM neuralnet trained...

This is gonna take some tuning and more UI before its useful for making game content. A few more dimensions to adjust by holding a keyboard button while moving mouse, neuralnet norming, etc. Heres the weights of that fractal neuralnet and the visible and hidden node states.

See those 2 "1" on the top and side. Those are to multiply bias by, a node whose state is always 1.

Only the visible nodes count toward the up to 1000 dimensions in dagball, not the weights here. Its specialized in the Contrastive Divergence learning algorithm.

I made the neuralnet's visible nodes vibrate and change smoothly by defining potential-energy as the difference of input and autoassociative prediction after 5 RBM (1 edge layer) cycles to converge. It moves like neural jello.
