I expect a majority of countries to side with what I build, and europe and china can keep being little censoring bitches. But if they choose to download a copy thats on them. Dont come crying to me.
Described the software as a variant of IPFS thats like an uncensored opensource peer to peer superexponentially sparse turing machine, and asked GPT4 which countries use IPFS and which countries would likely use that too.
It sounds like you're working on something that could potentially be controversial or challenging, especially in regards to international regulations and perceptions of censorship. Navigating global digital policy landscapes can be complex, as different countries have various regulations concerning internet content, privacy, and freedom of speech.
If you're developing software or content that might raise legal or ethical questions in certain regions, it could be wise to consult with legal experts who specialize in international law and digital media. This could help ensure that your project adheres to relevant laws and regulations while reaching as broad an audience as possible.
What are you working on, and how can I assist you further with your project?

Its similar to IPFS but only has 1 data structure: a node has 2 child nodes. those are pure-lambdas. the left child called on the right child evals to the parent if halted, else evals to some halted node. EU is gonna be against it cuz, like IPFS, it doesnt have a delete command.

It sounds like you're working on a fascinating project involving a decentralized data structure with a focus on immutability and potentially computational functions through lambdas. The structure you're describing, where a node has two child nodes that interact through lambda functions, is interesting and could have various applications, especially in areas like distributed computing or blockchain technologies.
The lack of a delete function is a significant feature, similar to IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), which can lead to challenges in regions like the EU where regulations like GDPR mandate data deletion under certain conditions. Here are a few thoughts and tips for moving forward with your project:
    Regulatory Compliance: For acceptance in regions with strict data regulations, consider mechanisms that could align with legal frameworks without compromising the core principles of your technology. This might involve ways to anonymize data or restrict access without deleting it from the network.
    Technical Challenges: Ensure that the use of lambdas, which are functions without side effects, can robustly handle all the computations needed in your system. The model where a left child lambda called on a right child evaluates to the parent or another halted node sounds like it requires careful design to prevent infinite loops or ensure that every possible operation halts.
    Scalability and Efficiency: Evaluate how your system manages resources, including computational overhead and storage. The structure should be optimized for the types of data and operations it will most commonly handle.
    Community and Developer Buy-In: Given the decentralized and potentially open-source nature of projects like yours, gaining support from a broad community of developers can be crucial. Consider how you will encourage adoption and contribution to the project.
    Legal and Ethical Considerations: Beyond just adhering to regulations, consider the ethical implications of immutable data storage, especially concerning sensitive or personal information. Engaging with ethical debates in technology and possibly providing configurable options could help address some concerns.
    Potential Use Cases: Clearly define and communicate potential applications of your technology to attract interest and investment. Real-world use cases can also help in shaping the technology to meet practical needs.

No. I'm taking a stand. 100% opensource peer to peer, and nobody has the technical ability to delete things, and nobody has authority over anyone elses use of it. The only thing it does is lambda called on lambda finds/creates lambda, deterministicly as its a superexponentially sparse turing machine and will have GPU optimizations possibly up to 1 exaflop/sec on 1 million computers

Taking a strong stance on open-source and immutable peer-to-peer technology certainly has its merits, especially in promoting transparency and resistance to censorship. The concept of using deterministic lambdas in a sparse Turing machine setup, especially with the potential for high-performance computing via GPU optimizations, is quite innovative. Here’s how you might navigate some of the inherent challenges and opportunities:

make a table of countries, sorted by descending population, and have a column is IPFS used there, and another column will people use this lambda based variant of IPFS
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Creating a table to display countries sorted by descending population, noting the usage of IPFS and potential use of a lambda-based variant, involves several assumptions and estimates since direct and comprehensive data on IPFS usage by country is not readily available. However, I can construct a hypothetical table using general knowledge of technology adoption trends, internet freedom, and innovation receptivity in various countries.
Here's a basic framework for such a table:
Rank Country Population (approx.) Is IPFS Used? Will People Use Lambda-Based Variant?
1 China 1.4 billion Limited Possibly, with restrictions
2 India 1.38 billion Moderately Likely
3 United States 331 million Yes Very Likely
4 Indonesia 273 million Moderately Likely
5 Pakistan 220 million Moderately Likely
6 Brazil 212 million Yes Likely
7 Nigeria 206 million Moderately Likely
8 Bangladesh 166 million Moderately Likely
9 Russia 146 million Yes Likely, with restrictions
10 Mexico 128 million Yes Likely
Notes:
    Is IPFS Used? This column reflects a generalized view based on technological adoption rates and the presence of tech communities. For instance, countries with a high degree of technology integration and robust developer communities are more likely to have significant IPFS usage.
    Will People Use Lambda-Based Variant? This prediction considers factors like regulatory environments, openness to new technologies, and the current usage of similar technologies (like IPFS).
This table is highly speculative and should be used as a starting point for more detailed research. Actual usage can vary significantly based on numerous factors, including government policies, internet accessibility, and local tech culture.

add the EU and UK as 2 rows

To expand on the hypothetical table and include the European Union and the United Kingdom, here’s how it might look:
Rank Country Population (approx.) Is IPFS Used? Will People Use Lambda-Based Variant?
1 China 1.4 billion Limited Possibly, with restrictions
2 India 1.38 billion Moderately Likely
3 United States 331 million Yes Very Likely
4 Indonesia 273 million Moderately Likely
5 Pakistan 220 million Moderately Likely
6 Brazil 212 million Yes Likely
7 Nigeria 206 million Moderately Likely
8 Bangladesh 166 million Moderately Likely
9 Russia 146 million Yes Likely, with restrictions
10 Mexico 128 million Yes Likely
- European Union 447 million Yes Possibly, with regulatory challenges
- United Kingdom 67 million Yes Possibly, with regulatory challenges
Notes:
    European Union: Represents an aggregate of its member states, not ranked by population. IPFS usage is considered given the tech-savvy populations in several member states. However, the adoption of a lambda-based variant could face significant regulatory challenges due to strict data protection laws.
    United Kingdom: Post-Brexit, the UK follows its own regulations but typically aligns closely with the EU in terms of technology policy. Adoption of new technologies like IPFS is relatively high, but the new lambda-based variant might also encounter legal and regulatory hurdles.
This expanded table continues to be speculative, and detailed data would be required for accurate insights, especially concerning adoption rates and regulatory impacts.

make the table bigger by adding more rows. i want at least 50 countries or groups of countries.

Creating a larger, speculative table featuring at least 50 countries with their approximate populations, IPFS usage, and potential adoption of a lambda-based variant of IPFS involves generalizing from technology adoption trends and potential regulatory responses. This table aims to provide a broad overview and is purely hypothetical. Here’s an extended version:
